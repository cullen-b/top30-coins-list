Email Cullen Baker at cullen77401@gmail.com any questions/issues/troubleshooting
Feel free to make any changes as you sees fit, just make sure to version up and comment what you changed

This code probably works better if you run it on your machine. 
If you know how, copy the code and run the python file on your computer.

Upgrades that would be cool to have:
- Compare new csv to an old csv and highlight any changes
- Run and automatically email the csv file + highlights
